Simple 3M SIP2 Standard Interchange Protocol implementation in perl


Why do we need another SIP2 implementation?

That's a great question! Mostly because others are wrong in one way or another, most
importantly: 


	protocol specifies that messages must end with <CR> (ASCII 13)

	most implementation put CR/LF or (even worse) just LF


This is very annoying, and creating simple and correct implementation seems to make sense.
